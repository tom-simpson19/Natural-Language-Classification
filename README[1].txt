This folder contains two python files.

The 'Full_bigram.py' file contains the full python script including the cross validation
methodhowever. This file is very computations heavy in terms in RAM and time.

I have taken the best hyper-parameters found and directly input them into the classifier in a new python 
file called 'reduced_bigram.py'. All the code is the same except I have removed the cross-validation method 
for a quicker run-time. This took about 50 minutes to run on my machine the full file took around 3 hours.

This code did use approximately 20GB of RAM.

The additional languages that I used in my algorithm came with a license at the bottom. I removed them but have 
put them in seperate .rtf files called spanish_text_license.rtf, french_text_license.rtf
